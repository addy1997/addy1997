### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

_I am Adwait, an Electronics engineer by profession with a knack for learning to program intelligent machines. A roboticist by choice and guitarist in leisure time, I like to learn new languages(I already can speak 7) and do speed cubing when I am not punching keys on my computer.
Previously, I worked at HTIC, IIT-Madras with the Spine Robotics team on an amazing project based on Image Guided Surgery (IGS) for the UR5 robotic arm.
Previous to that, I was a summer fellow at CVIT, IIIT-H. In my sophomore year, I worked as robotics intern at KUKA, India along with the team of few engineers from ISRO on developing motion planning algorithms for robotic arms.
Currently, I am waiting to join my master's at University of Bristol in Robotics._
